# school_c_os_simulator

This is my single threaded operating system simulator. I wrote this project for my operating systems class at NAU.


My professor started us out by writing the simtimer.c/h, stringUtils.c/h, SimTimerCode, and sim instructions files.


Make file command with gcc: make -f simulator_mf
