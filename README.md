# C Operating System Simulator

This is my single threaded operating system simulator. I wrote this project for my operating systems class at NAU.


My professor started us out by writing the simtimer.c/h, stringUtils.c/h, SimTimerCode, and sim instructions files.


Instructions
  * Make file command with gcc: "make -f simulator_mf".
  * Run executable with "./sim".
  * After reading the instructions from the executable, use the sample logifile_1.lgf or metadata_1.mdf files to run the simulator.
